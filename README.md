A amm is deployed on STARKNET: 

## Commune Society Token (CST)

There exists a vast array of assets in the world which people freely choose as a store of value, a transactional medium, or an investment. We believe the Ethereum blockchain is a better technology for transacting, storing, and accounting for these assets.

CST Token uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of CST is carried out by 2nd layer of Ethereum such as STARKWARE, zkSync Optimism. CST is open-source; everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, CST allows exciting uses.

A digital token provides individuals and organizations with a robust and decentralized method of exchanging value while using a familiar accounting unit. The innovation of blockchains is an auditable and cryptographically secured global ledger. Asset Backed token issuers and other market participants can take advantage of blockchain technology, along with embedded consensus systems, to transact in familiar, less volatile currencies and assets.

##bPhilosophy
Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2008 has being one of the first successful examples of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or intrinsic value and no centralized issuer or controller. Decentralizing.
Through the years the Bitcoin experiment has shown us that in many things Satoshi was right about, one of them is - There are a lot more people interested in centralizing and tokenization than we know.

Also, Satoshi wrote in 2009 “I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using electronic currency in some way, now we know a way to do it......” We not sure if now happening exactly what he was expecting, but we should say that every year blockchain technology is growing and crypto assets getting more and more confession and attention then years back.
Bitcoin showed us an example of blockchain technology that includes using digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (crypto coins), as well as more complex applications or even blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations and more. He called it The Internet of Value, people calling it The Internet of Money, but we like to say The Internet of Opportunities.
Motivation
Bitcoin primarily as alternative way of money, as digital gold. It took many years to became more valuable. But it’s more than that, nowadays it’s became new culture, communitie, new vector for enthusiasts and technology and more.

With the advent of bitcoin opened the opportunity for development of decentralization. On other side, decentralization means some risks. Diversification is the right way to reduce risks. In addition, decentralization should not be monopoly.

What CST intends to provide is right of choice in a blockchain world, decentralizing with a built-in smart-contract and diversification of digital actives of user and much more. Decentralizing allowing users to use any of the tools described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined. CST Token upgrades every year getting better and better.

It took many years for Bitcoin to become more trusted and itself is not widely adopted outside the internet yet. But crypto-entusiasts, like us, want to popularize the blockchain technology, tools and more outside the internet as well.
Internet of Value
Throughout history, banks and third-party institutions have existed to provide trust between multiple parties of a transaction. Bitcoin radically changed this construct, allowing transactions to take place within a blockchain protocol, without the need to depend on third-party entities.

By moving trust from the intermediary to the protocol, Bitcoin changed the way money flows and set the stage for the Internet of Value. 
Bitcoin was created as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.” Bitcoin created a new class of digital currency, a decentralized digital currency or cryptocurrency .
All the Blockchain initiatives we talk about today, including Ethereum and CST Token are a result of Bitcoin.

Although Bitcoin may be more well known, because if exists from 2008 and was made aggressive marketing and distributions. But the most important here is the basic idea of Nakomoto.

CST Token was inspired, supportive and willing to move forward the idea of Satoshi about Internet of Value. Or like we say in our community — Internet of Possibilities.
Mission
The intent of CST is to become widely adopted an alternative way for transactions, deals and more. We believe that is very useful to have different set of trade offs with particular emphasis on situations where rapid transaction time, security, and the ability of different kind of actives, applications to very efficiently interact, are important. CST Token can be used as “digital currency” and be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply now.

The CST Token was originally conceived as an upgraded alternative version of a cryptocurrency, providing advanced features. What is more interesting is that the EC20 Token can move far beyond just crypto-currency. Smart contracts, fast transactions and other advantages of CST Token around decentralized blockchain and decentralized markets, among dozens of other such concepts, have the potential to substantially increase features and usage of the crypto industry, and provide a massive boost to other peer-to-peer world by adding for the first time an economic layer. Finally, there is also a substantial array of potential that have nothing to do with money at all.

Progress does not stand still, and in the future many issues and problems can be resolved. CST Token with a built-in smart-contract introduced the future needs and desires of users and make it possible to carry out reliable and confidential transactions without the participation of external intermediaries in the person of banks or other third parties.

The concept of decentralizing and “Internet of money” as implemented by the CST Token provides for users with unique potential; rather than being a closed-ended and borders limited, transaction's time limited, tools limited, CST Token is open-ended by design, and we believe that it is extremely well-suited to serving as a foundational layer for a very large number of both financial and non-financial world in the years to come..
Objective
CST Token is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with operating system featuring smart contract functionality in erc-20 standard protocol. It based and inspired on modified version of Satoshi Nakamoto's idea about Internet of Value.

Like Bitcoin or Ethereum — CST Token is an open-source project built by small team but very soon many people around the world started developing and join the CST Token community. But unlike the Bitcoin CST was designed to be more adaptable, faster, flexible with full potential to adapt in future for world needs and upcoming “updates”.

CST Token is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain).

We have a long way to go, I believe we have done a good job being pragmatic, flexible and realizing that we will develop and grow every day to find optimal decision-making and coordination system and usage for users, we are on our way there.
Where we are today
Future Innovations. Multi­sig and Smart Contracts. 
CST Token with a built-in smart-contract make it possible to carry out reliable and confidential transactions without the participation of external intermediaries in the person of banks or other third parties.

Tokens can be bought through online trading platforms (exchanges and exchangers), or in personal transactions (the sender and receptionist agree personally). The token trading process itself is identical to the typical trading process.

CST Tokens are stored and sent using Ethereum addresses and transactions. In the processes of transfer and storage is very simple. For this, digital wallets are used that implement the storage and processing of send and receive, convert, exchange etc, as well as the formation and signing of transactions. Wallets became tokenization platform infrastructure.
Some of the primary advantages of CST Token are: low transaction costs, international borderless transferability and convertibility, trustless ownership and exchange, pseudo­anonymity, real­time transparency, and immunity from legacy banking system problems.
Therefore, the CST Token with a built-in smart-contract introduced nowadays and the future needs, desires of users. Any user of CST Token is able to take advantage of the extended benefits of a smart-contract.

Among the main advantages of smart-contracts are:
* autonomy (to conclude and confirm the transaction, you do not need to look for an intermediary represented by a broker, bank, notary, etc.);
* reliability and security (a duplicate of a contract is stored in encrypted form on the blockchain);
* the security of the system is guaranteed by mathematical laws and make not possible the hacker attacks, as well as the substitution of information retroactively;
* Savings and speed — thanks to the blockchain, many intermediaries are eliminated and processes are automated;
* accuracy — due to automation and minimization of manual work, the likelihood of errors that often appear when filling out forms during the approval process and when carrying out various contract operations manually is reduced.
